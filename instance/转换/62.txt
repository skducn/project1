 Hey, Happy 6th to Festival! Larger Kuala Loh, Hangzhou Dalek. Larger Kuala Loh, today is June 2nd. It's a very special festival in Hangzhou. Only the Hangzhou people, they know this. I still remember when in 1999, I came to Hangzhou to study, and this year is my 25th year. I've been lived here 25 years. My first Hangzhou Dalek that I learned, nǐ zhōgāo lòr, I'm like, oh, what does that mean? In my classroom at that time, there was a Hangzhou people. So they explained to me, nǐ zhōgāo lòr, that means you are quite simple. You are not very complicated, right? Naive, something like that. I'm like, oh, okay. So that's my first Hangzhou Dalek. And after that, I learned 6th to also means box. For example, jīsēn, qīpō gōnāo zhōlòr, gōlē. Jīsēn, please give me a box. So box also means 6th to. I wonder if there is any other meaning behind 6th to in Hangzhou Dalek or in your hometown, my friends from all over China or from all over the world, is there any special meaning? 6th to. Happy 6th to Festival. Lòr jī kǎu lòr.
